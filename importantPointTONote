1)File annotated with @ControllerAdvice should be viable to componentscan .You can
not just put it anywhere and think it will get scanned.Inwhere you have put @EnableWebMvc
and there the component scan which is mainly the controller package , putit there and it will get
 scanned

2)@ResponseStatus(value= HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND, reason="IOException occured")
Can be used mainly with {@ExceptionHandler(FileNotFoundException.class)}
in rest based spring services where you need to return a specfic status code and
message which is more of override
